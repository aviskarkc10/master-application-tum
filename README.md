These are a 2014 essay and statement of purpose from applying for a master's degree program in Computer Science at Technische Universität München (TUM). I am not particularly proud of this essay, nor do I still agree with everything I wrote in it. I am leaving it online as I have repeatedly received feedback that it is a helpful example.

While I was admitted, please keep in mind that I had completed my undergrad at TUM, which likely helped my admission chances. Don’t think this essay is a perfect example of what was expected. I did not start my master’s at TUM, so I can’t answer any questions about the program. I’m not even sure they still ask for an essay!

I loved TUM as an undergrad, so I can empathize with everyone’s enthusiasm about getting in. Please keep in mind that applications in academia are always stochastic, so please apply to multiple universities. I wish you the best of luck with _your_ experience of higher education!
